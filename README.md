## Description

This CRUD application is a starter project that I am currently working on that will allow users to blog about something of interest. **NOTE: This project does not yet have authenticaton implemented.** Right now from the Welcome page, either click the Let's Blog button or click 'Posts' from the drop down menu. Once on the Posts page, a user can read previous posts from users, create a new post, delete posts or edit posts. All posts are stored in an SQLite database.

## Implementation

This project is implemented using Flask, Python 3.8, Bootstrap, HTML and SQLALchemy.
